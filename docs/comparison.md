# Snow vs Now

There are tradeoffs to using `snow` and `now`.

## Features

### Multi-region deployments

Now's Anycast DNS service and load balancers allows serving content as close as possible to users. Since the load balancer implementations used by Kubernetes provide similar functionality (e.g., [Google Cloud Load Balancing]), it may be possible to provide this functionality in the future when the [Multicluster SIG] API's reach general availability. A beta [multicluster ingress](`kubemci`) serves as a working proof-of-concept.

### Internal deployments

On snow, each deployment is associated with a kubernetes service. Each service is assigned an address from the service [address range] (e.g., `10.0.0.0/20`). You can use this IP Address to talk between deployments, without exposing the deployment on the public internet.

On some cloud providers, by keeping traffic between deployments in the same zone/region, you might save on network ingress/egress costs as well.

### Serverless lambdas

Today, Serverless lambdas are out of scope for `snow`.

## Operating Cost

Costs will vary depend on which cloud you choose. These are minimal costs-- in a production setting, you might want a minimum of 2 compute instances, for example, to ensure high availability.
